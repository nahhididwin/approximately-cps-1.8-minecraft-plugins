# approximately-cps-1.8-minecraft-plugins
1 plugins calculates the approximate number of clicks per second (cps), because in minecraft version 1.8.9 it is very difficult to measure cps accurately, so this plugins uses the closest possible approximation.

Approximate performance details:

I tried clicking from 1cps -> 23cps (measured accurately with lunar client, client-side).

And approximately-cps-1.8-minecraft-plugins approximated about 17-18cps, sometimes with a little delay in cps, it's not very suitable for measuring cps accurately, but in anticheat systems I think it's very good.
